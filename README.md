Overview of the Project Project:Smart Home IOT system using arduino

Objective:
To design and implement a smart home system using IoT and Arduino that enhances convenience, improves energy efficiency, and ensures security by automating home appliances and providing remote control through internet-connected devices.

Key Activities:

System Design and Planning
Identify key functionalities (e.g., lighting control, temperature monitoring, security systems).
Choose compatible sensors, actuators, and communication modules.
Component Integration

Connect sensors (e.g., temperature, motion, gas, light) to the Arduino.
Integrate actuators such as relays, servo motors, and smart plugs.
Microcontroller Programming

Write Arduino code to process sensor data and control outputs.
Implement logic for automation (e.g., turn on lights when motion is detected).

Technology-Based Components:
Hardware
Microcontroller: Arduino Uno, Mega, or Nano.
Sensors:
Temperature and Humidity (e.g., DHT11, DHT22).
Light (e.g., LDR).
Motion (e.g., PIR sensor).
Gas/Smoke (e.g., MQ-2).

Actuators:
Relays for switching appliances.
Servo motors for door locks.
LED lights or smart bulbs.

Software
Arduino IDE for programming.
Cloud platforms like Firebase or Blynk for IoT integration.
Mobile app frameworks (e.g., MIT App Inventor) for interface design.
